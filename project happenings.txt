first prime number generated was:
318831468460481049114126232101899133976907367481127
a simple divide until sqrt(n) python program took more than an hour to run, maybe bug with the code? maybe not

adding fermat test dropped the recursive depth that the generatePrime would go to by a lot.. like.. a really really lot


can calculate d really fast, not finding mod inverse as in de = 1 (mod totient)
this is same as de = totient * (some integer k) + 1



DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE BIGnum in generateCandidate to a big number!!!
