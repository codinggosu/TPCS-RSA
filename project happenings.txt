first prime number generated was:
318831468460481049114126232101899133976907367481127
a simple divide until sqrt(n) python program took more than an hour to run, maybe bug with the code? maybe not

adding fermat test dropped the recursive depth that the generatePrime would go to by a lot.. like.. a really really lot
