use fermat test?
General Strategy:

test if n is prime by:
a^(n-1) = 1 (mod n)
if the above holds, a is a witness

however, we have to worry about carmichael numbers

=====================================================================
questions:
make primeSieve private?
does the private and public assignment of variables and functions matter?

room for improvement:

miller rabin:
However, if the smallest composite number that passes a particular set of tests is known ahead of time, then that set of tests constitutes a primality proof for all smaller numbers. The sequence of smallest odd numbers passing a multiple Rabin-Miller test using the first k primes for k=1, 2, ... is given by 2047, 1373653, 25326001, 3215031751, 2152302898747, 3474749660383, 341550071728321, 341550071728321, ... (OEIS A014233; Jaeschke 1993). Therefore, multiple Rabin tests using the first 7 primes (using 8 gives no improvement) are valid for every number up to 3.4Ã—10^(14).
