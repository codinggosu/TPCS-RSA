# TPCS-RSA
### RSA implementation for "Theory and Practice in Computational Sciences" course


## Main modules/functions
#### prime generation
* checking randomly generated b + 2i number with 1. dividing by small prime numbers check, 2. fermat test, 3. miller rabin test 
#### fast exponentiation
* in process

#### web interface in django for visualization and interaction
* in process


## Room for improvement:
* optimize miller rabin test(?)
* exchange symmetric key with RSA and do symmetric key encryption/decryption after that
